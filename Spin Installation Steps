Step 1
	Download the zip file from github (https://github.com/nimble-code/Spin)
	Paste it in the home folder
	Extract it there.
	SpinMaster folder will be extracted.

Step 2
	Open the terminal in the SpinMaster folder
	Run the following commands
	   sudo apt-get update -y
	   sudo apt-get install -y bison
	navigate to "Src" (cd Src)
	run "sudo su"
	run "make" 
	
Step 3
	Run "ls" command and you can see the spin executable file in green colour.
	Also if you open the "optional_gui" folder in Spin_master you can see the 'iSPin.tlc' file as well.
	
Step 4 - Setting the path for the spin executable

	Open a terminal in the home directory
	Run "sudo su"
	Open the bash file in any text editor
	gedit ~/.bashrc
	Copy the file path of spin exe file and iSPin.tlc from the file manager 
	(in this case : /home/alan/Spin-master/Src & /home/alan/Spin-master/optional_gui)
	
	Add folllowing code at the end of the bashrc file
	
	#SPIN and
	export PATH="/home/alan/Spin-master/Src:$PATH"

	#SPIN and 
	export PATH="/home/alan/Spin-master/optional_gui:$PATH"

	Save & Close the bashrc file.

Step 5 - Asking the OS to consider the new bashrc file whenever I type "spin" command.

	Go back to the terminal opened and run : source ~/.bashrc
	Now if you run spin command in the same terminal you will get the spin version info and and an
	ERROR Msg stating no file name specified.
	
Step 6 - Opening GUI
	
	Close the previous terminal.
	Open the optional_gui folder.
	Open a terminal from there.
	Execute the iSPin.tcl file.
	(./ispin.tcl)
	Error stating no version of SPIN found.
	Get into super user privileges.
	(sudo su)
	Then execute the ispin.tcl file.
	The GUI will open up.
	
Possible Errors - while executing ispin.tcl
